# T-004 

An Arduino based 2 wheeled robot controlled via a remote joystick. Data transmission
is done via IR. The goal was to keep the robot small (still using breadboards).

Originally started with Attiny85 (Digispark) so I could keep everything on a single mini breadboard.
Ran into a number of technical difficulties and so added the chassis.
